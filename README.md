-----------------

In my daily work, the most part of my work is to build a score card model and I've found I write some code repeatedly almost every time, so why don't I build a package? Before doing this I found there is already a tool named [scorecardpy](https://github.com/ShichenXie/scorecardpy) out of the shelf with 300+ stars on Github.

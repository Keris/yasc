YASC
====

YASC is short for Yet Another Score Card.

Why I build YASC?
-----------------

In my daily work, the most work I do is to build a score card model and there is already a tool named [scorecardpy](https://github.com/ShichenXie/scorecardpy) out of the shelf. But after serveral times of using of it, I found some flaws of it:

- Not very Pythonic
- No documents
- The plots are not very pretty
- ...

Based on above reasons I try to build a new one.
